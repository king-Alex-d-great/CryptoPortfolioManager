## Question 1 - Programming
_We're looking at your programming ability. It must not only work, it should be maintainable._

Let us assume you are a crypto investor. You have made transactions over a period of time which is logged in a [CSV file](https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.propine.com/transactions.csv.zip). Write a command line program that does the following

 - Given no parameters, return the latest portfolio value per token in USD
 - Given a token, return the latest portfolio value for that token in USD
 - Given a date, return the portfolio value per token in USD on that date
 - Given a date and a token, return the portfolio value of that token in USD on that date

The CSV file has the following columns
 - timestamp: Integer number of seconds since the Epoch
 - transaction_type: Either a DEPOSIT or a WITHDRAWAL
 - token: The token symbol
 - amount: The amount transacted

Portfolio means the balance of the token where you need to add deposits and subtract withdrawals. You may obtain the exchange rates from [cryptocompare](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/) where the API is free. You should write it in Node.js as our main stack is in Javascript/Typescript and we need to assess your proficiency.
